When you downgrade your plan, you will lose access to certain features and have reduced limits on your account. If at the time of downgrade you are over your song limit of your new plan, your players will be disabled within 24 hours until you delete some songs.

### Help, my players are still disabled even after removing songs!

In some rare cases, you may have players that still show disabled after you've removed songs to be within your new plan's song limit. This is a result of our caching system.

To fix this, you can trigger a cache refresh by making a small change to your player and saving it. This will force the cache to be cleared.

If for some reason this doesn't work, please contact support via the chat widget in the MixFlip app and we will manually clear the cache.

As with all billing functions in MixFlip, you can cancel your plan at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal, accessible from the MixFlip app dashboard's "Account" tab. This will put you on the Free plan at the end of your current billing cycle.

### Step 1: Go to the Account Page

### Step 3: Confirm Cancellation

On this page, you'll be asked to confirm that you want to cancel your subscription. If you continue with the cancellation, you'll still have access to your account until the end of your current billing cycle.

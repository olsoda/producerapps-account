You can switch between plans at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal, accessible from the MixFlip app dashboard's "Account" tab. If you're on a trial, you must add a credit card to your account before you can switch to the pro plan.

:::note

Please note that all plan changes made via the Stripe Billing Portal will take effect immediately on a prorated basis. If you want to change your plan at the end of your current billing cycle, please contact support via the chat widget in the MixFlip app.

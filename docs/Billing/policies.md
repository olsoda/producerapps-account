## Billing Policies

We now offer both monthly and yearly billing plans. You can choose the plan that best fits your needs. Policies for monthly plans remain the same, and yearly plans have their own refund policy described below.

## Refund Policy

We offer a 30-day refund policy for all NEW subscriptions (e.g. after the first invoice is generated). After that, we don't offer refunds for monthly renewals (e.g. if you've been a customer for a few months, you can't refund your monthly subscription).

For **yearly plans**, you can request a refund within 30 days after each yearly billing, including renewals. This means that after your yearly plan renews, you have 30 days to request a refund for that renewal. After that, you can't request a refund for that yearly plan. Any cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.

## Cancellation Policy

All cancellations are processed at the end of the current billing cycle. If your subscription is due to be cancelled, you can still use the service until the end of the current billing cycle.

## Upgrade Policy

If you have a subscription on the Standard Plan, you can upgrade to the Pro Plan at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal at a pro-rated rate. This will take effect immediately and it will give you a breakdown of the cost of the upgrade at the checkout.

## Downgrade Policy

If you have a subscription on the Pro Plan, you can downgrade to the Standard Plan at any time via the Stripe Billing Portal.

If you wish to downgrade to the Free plan, just cancel your subscription via the Stripe Billing Portal and you will be downgraded to the Free plan at the end of your current billing cycle.

### Dowgrading and Plan Limits

When you downgrade your plan, you will lose access to certain features and have reduced limits on your account. If at the time of downgrade you are over your song limit of your new plan, your players will be disabled until you delete some songs.

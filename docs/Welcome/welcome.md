## Getting Started

Welcome to Mixflip Documentation

### What is Mixflip?

MixFlip is a portfolio player for mixing and mastering engineers to win more clients by showing website visitors the "before and after" of their work.

### Songs vs Players 101

In MixFlip, you create songs, then add those songs to a particular "player". A player is a playlist of songs that you embed in one particular spot on your website.

We seperate the concept of a song from a player because a song can be used in multiple players.

For example, you could have a song included in your main portfolio playlist, but also have that song as the only song in a player if you're doing a blog post about that particular song.

You can also have a song included in multiple players, if you want to show the "before and after" of a song in different places on your website where you're highlighting different services or genres.

## App Sections

The MixFlip app dashboard is broken down into four main sections:

- Song Library - where you create and manage your songs
- Players - where you create and manage your players (playlists of songs)
- Landing Pages - where you create and manage your landing pages
- Account - where you manage your account and billing. This is also your link to the Stripe Billing Portal, where you can manage your subscription and payment details.

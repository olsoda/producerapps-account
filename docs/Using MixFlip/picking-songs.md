Picking which songs to include in your portfolio is an important decision. Here are some things to consider when picking songs:

### Song Quality

A good song will always be more impactful than a mediocre song – no matter the fidelity of the audio. We reccomend picking the best songs in your portfolio – not just the ones you think sound the best from a technical standpoint.

### Number of Songs in Portfolio

One of the biggest mistakes we see are portfolio players with too many songs. We reccomend including 5-7 songs in your portfolio. Generally no more, no less.

Too few songs and it looks like you're not in demand, too many songs and it looks like you're trying too hard. Basically, pick the songs that you think are the best, but don't overdo it.

We reccomend creating Spotify and Apple Music playlists for your complete discography.

### Full Song or Just a Snippet?

While you can upload the entire song, we reccomend using just a snippet of the song for your main "homepage" portfolio. This is both for promotional reasons, but also for the sake of keeping the audio files your users are streaming to a minimum.

The point of your main "homepage" portfolio isn't for people to sit and listen to your entire song, but rather for people to see what you're all about and get them interested enough to reach out to you.

If people like the song, you can link to it on Spotify or Apple Music, and they'll be able to listen to it as a part of their regular listening routine.

If you want to show the entire song on your website, we reccomend using the classic player. The before-and-after player is best used for showcasing a snippet of your song in our experience.

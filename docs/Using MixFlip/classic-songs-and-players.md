description: How to use classic songs and players in MixFlip
---

In addition to our marquee feature of MixFlip in before-and-after playback, we also support classic players. This is a feature that allows you to upload and display your entire song on your website without needing to show the before and after.

Every song in MixFlip can have both before/after audio (for use in MixFlip players) and a classic audio file (for use in Classic players). The classic audio is simply an additional upload field for each song—there is no separate "classic song type." This means you can upload before/after snippets for comparison, and also upload the full song as classic audio, all within the same song entry.

This is great for showcasing your entire song, such as a full arrangement or a finished track. If you're a producer, you can use this to showcase your arrangement skills when it makes more sense to show the entire song rather than a before and after.

**Classic Players** are similar to our MixFlip players, but they only show songs that have classic audio uploaded. The same song can appear in both MixFlip and Classic players, depending on which audio files are present.

## Uploading Classic Audio

To upload classic audio:
1. Go to the [MixFlip Dashboard](https://mixflip.producerapps.com/dashboard) and click on the "Song Library" tab.
2. Click "New Song" and enter the song name and artist, then click "Save and Next".
3. On the edit page, you can upload before/after audio (for MixFlip players) and/or a classic audio file (for Classic players).
4. Upload your classic audio file (MP3 for free plans, MP3/FLAC/WAV for paid plans; file size limits depend on your plan).
5. Optionally, upload album artwork (JPG/PNG, max 5MB).
6. You can remove uploaded files by clicking the trash icon next to them. Deleted files are removed after saving.
7. The save button is only enabled when you have unsaved changes. You'll see a badge indicating "Unsaved Changes" or "Changes Saved". You can discard changes to revert to the last saved state.
8. If you try to leave the page with unsaved changes, you'll get a warning.
9. Click "Save Song" to upload your files and update the song.

**Note:**
- File format and size restrictions depend on your plan. Free plans allow MP3 only; paid plans allow MP3, FLAC, and WAV, and larger file sizes.
- Error messages will appear if you try to upload unsupported formats or files that are too large.
- You can include a song in multiple players (MixFlip and/or Classic), depending on which audio files are uploaded.

For more information on preparing your files for uploading, check out [Prepping Your Audio Files](../prepping-files). For more information on supported audio formats, check out [Supported Audio Formats](../supported-audio-formats).

## Creating a Classic Player

1. Go to the "Players" tab in your dashboard.
2. Click "New Player" and select the **Classic** player type.
3. Enter a name for your player.
4. Add songs to your player. Only songs with classic audio uploaded will be available.
5. You can reorder songs by dragging, and remove them from the player at any time.
6. Customize your player's appearance, layout, and playlist display using the available options (colors, fonts, artwork display, etc.).
7. Save your changes. The save button is only enabled when you have unsaved changes.
8. You can see which landing pages use this player and jump to edit them directly from the player editor.

**Tip:** Classic players are perfect for production/songwriting portfolios or any use case where you want to showcase full tracks without before/after toggling.

# Landing Page Guide

## What is a Landing Page?
A MixFlip landing page is a customizable, shareable web page where you can showcase your music, playlists, and links—all styled to match your brand. It's perfect for sharing on social media, in your bio, or as a mini-website for your releases, services, or portfolio.

## Creating a Landing Page
1. Go to the **Landing Pages** tab in your MixFlip dashboard.
2. Click **New Landing Page**.
3. Enter a name for your landing page.
4. Select which player (playlist) you want to feature on the page.

## Customizing Your Landing Page

### Custom URL
- Set a unique path for your landing page. The editor will check if your chosen path is available.
- You can edit the path at any time, but old links will stop working if you change it.

### Headline and Body Copy
- Add a headline (up to 50 characters) and a body paragraph (up to 500 characters) to introduce yourself, your project, or your offer.
- Style your headline and body: choose alignment, color, bold, italic, and underline for the headline.

### Header Image
- Upload a header image (JPG/PNG, max 5MB) to display at the top of your page.
- Adjust the image shape (circle or square), size, and border (color and width).
- You can remove or replace the image at any time.

### Background Image and Color
- Upload a background image (JPG/PNG, max 5MB) for your page.
- Set a background color and adjust its opacity to create overlay effects.

### Picking a Player
- Select which MixFlip player (playlist) to feature. The landing page will inherit the player's accent color and font by default, but you can override these.
- You can change the player at any time. The page will update to match the new player's style unless you've set overrides.

### Colors and Fonts
- Override the accent color, text color, and font family for your landing page if you want a different look from your player.
- Reset any override to return to the player's default.

### Social Links
- Add links to your social media profiles (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Instagram, etc.).
- Each platform has its own icon and URL validation.
- Drag and drop to reorder your social links.

### Standard Links (Buttons)
- Add up to 10 custom links (e.g., website, store, email, etc.).
- Each link can have a label and a URL (https:// or email address).
- Drag and drop to reorder links. Edit or delete links at any time.

### Global Link/Button Styles
- Set global styles for your link buttons: background color, text color, bold, italic, underline, button shape (standard, squared, pill), and shadow (color, offset, blur, spread).
- All links will inherit these styles unless you set a custom color for an individual button.

### Saving and Publishing
- The editor shows a badge for unsaved changes or when changes are saved.
- You must save your changes for them to go live. You can discard changes to revert to the last saved version.
- The landing page is live at your chosen URL as soon as you save.

## Tips for Musicians and Producers
- Use your landing page as a link-in-bio, EPK, or mini-website for a release.
- Feature a playlist of your best work, a single, or a service offering.
- Add all your socials and important links so fans and clients can find you easily.
- Customize the look to match your brand or the vibe of your project.

## Advanced Features
- Drag and drop to reorder social and standard links.
- Inherit styles from your player for a consistent look, or override them for a unique landing page.
- Add, remove, or update images and links at any time.

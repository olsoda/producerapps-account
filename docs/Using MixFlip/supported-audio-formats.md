MixFlip supports a wide variety of audio formats. Keep in mind that we're not encoding your audio, so you'll need to make sure that your files are in the correct format before uploading them.

## Supported Audio Formats

### Supported Codecs

MixFlip supports Stereo files with the following audio codecs:

- MP3
- FLAC
- WAV

These codecs are supported by all modern browsers and devices.

### Supported Sample Rates and Bit Depths

MixFlip officially supports audio in 16-bit, 44.1kHz. While we don't restrict you from using 24-bit or 48kHz, we don't officially support them as they might cause issues on some browsers and devices.

### Supported File Sizes

MixFlip songs support files up to 60MB in size. This is enough for a 5-min song in WAV format. However, we recommend using smaller files for better performance for your users on mobile – remember each song has two files (before and after), so keep in mind that you'll be using twice as much data as normal.

For classic songs, we allow files up to 100MB in size.

## Our Recommendations

:::note

[Did you know that about 2/3 of all web traffic is mobile?](https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet) We recommend using MP3 files for best results for your website visitors on mobile (especially if you want to upload an entire song).

We recommend using MP3 files for best results for your website visitors on mobile (especially if you want to upload an entire song). We also recommend using FLAC files if you're using a lossless codec, as they're smaller and faster to upload than WAV files.

If you're looking for a high-qaulity audio encoder program for creating MP3, we reccomend using [XLD](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/) on Mac as it's free and supports the LAME encoder (the best sounding MP3 encoder out there). It also can convert WAV files to FLAC files.

Our reccomended settings for converting WAV files to MP3 with XLD are:
